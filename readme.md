    This project will be do as an evolve project, from some easy steps, with basic definitions of the final project, to more
    complex steps where the hardest complexity will be included. 

    The first step has been started. In this step it must be specified the JSON file structure, as well
    some kind of method or function able to create and read the JSON structures. In this first step, an easy example
    able to show at least different types of graphs will be done. To draw graphs, it will be used a graphical library called
    Flotr2 (http://www.humblesoftware.com/flotr2/documentation#introduction). 
    
    The information to draw a graph will be obtained from a JSON file (to make it easy, the JSON file will be stored locally.
    In other steps, to add more complexity, the data can be obtained from an AJAX call which return the JSON structure).

    The JSON structure which will be used in this project will contain the type(area, lines, bars, ..) of the graph.Furthermore,
    it will also containt the data of the graph that is going to be shown. An example of the structure can be something like
    {"type":"area","dataX":[]
